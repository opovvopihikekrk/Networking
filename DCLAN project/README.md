This folder has 2 pkt files, one represents the base scenario of the UPV network that is going to be upgraded, the other one is the upgraded network. These are the improvements that we needed to implement:

The	 objective	 of	 this	 work	 is	 to	 introduce	 multiple	 enhancements	 to	 the	 UPV
network	 represented	 to	improve	its	 performance,	 security	and	 functionality.	The	
final	 network	 configuration	 must	 segregate	 traffic	 into	 different	 VLANs,	 provide	
authentication	for	wireless	clients	using	a	RADIUS	server,	and	provide	redundancy	
to	the	network(STP)
